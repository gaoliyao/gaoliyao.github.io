## My story
One of the most important work for me in 2017 is MessageOnTap. MessageOnTap is an intelligent agent for instant messaging application through the length of personal data. People spend most of their time on Messaging Applications when using smartphones. As an important port of communication, messaging applications exchange a lot of information. Sometimes, people might need to store or retrieve information using other services on smartphones, such as photos or calendar. Users, often times, need to be the glue that connects different apps together.[1] However, the smartphones actually do able to get all of the information. This will not only save time for the user, but also increase the capability of smartphones. We were trying to combine personal data with cooresponding opeartions on smartphones. 


I first heard about the idea in 2016 from [Fanglin Chen](http://fanglin-chen.strikingly.com/), a PhD student in Carnegie Mellon University. His instructor is [Jason Hong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/). At the very beginning, Fanglin introduced me with the idea of MessageOnTap with a series of scnarios (23 as I remembered). The architecture used to be a mess. After a long discussion and prototypes of some scnarios, we finally were able to find the basic architecture. NLP -> SQL -> UI. It is the first time for us to clearify the logical sequence. We implemented some utils for personal data analyze and natural language processing which includes TimeParser and LocationClustering. TimeParser and LocationClustering described two interesting algorithm to solve problem of understanding time in a sentence and understanding user's visited place list with coordinates data.


Four months later, I went back to CMU once again. Learned from the NLP technique of Search Engine, I tried to analyze the questions and identify the sentence's keywords. Then I tried to implement the whole architecture. The first essential problem was getting the keyword of the sentence. At that time, Trump and Hillary was on the same weight. I tried to use the test case, "Will you vote for Hillary". As Fanglin told me, I tried to combine the stanford post-tagger and open knowledge base to do keyword understanding. Without using deep learning methods, I tried to catch the keyword then using open knowledge base to map the category, to perform the Named Entity Recognition. Then we worked so much on understanding the user with personal data. This shuold be our main contribution to the community. The AI should be able to understand human beings but currently, the whole community ignored it. So we implemented SemanticLocationClustering to let the smartphone understand user's semantic location, such as 'home' or 'office'. Our approach can link the semantic location with real coordinates. ( I worked a lot on it last year when passing the new year from 2016 to 2017. I wandered on the empty street in Pittsburgh. We played Majong that day and my friend was ill. We visited ER.)


We designed the user experiments and created the demo application using the Firebase service. The process of our experiment was not smoothly but the result was good. This is the very first time for me to see a huge and impossible project became true. I tested a lot and showed off to all of my friends. We submitted a paper to Ubicomp. Unfortunately, the paper was not accepted. With a firm believe of our motivation on this project, we still decided to work on it. Working with [Adam](https://www.adamyi.com/) and Mingquan, we almost finished all of the architecture in Auguest 2017. The second version of MessageOnTap was also rejected. 

During my time in CMU, I met a lot of interesting people there. I worked a lot with Fanglin. He was really a creative researcher. He tried a lot to search new methods to solve the old problems. His idea of MessageOnTap was actually very interesting and straight forward. Even if I am not working on it any more, I still hope this technique can be largely used one day. [Yuanchun](http://ylimit.github.io/) was a visiting Ph.D. from Peking University. We were in the same lab, and the project that I was working on used Yuanchun's [PrivacyStreams](https://github.com/PrivacyStreams/PrivacyStreams) as the base API. He is really strong at system developing and his paper was clear. [Anhong](http://www.guoanhong.com/) and [Xu](http://www.iamxuwang.com/) are very nice people with interesting works. I did not have a working experience with them but we met a lot for entertainments. They tricked me a lot on Avalon (kind of a puzzle game). [Di](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diw1/) also tricked me a lot on the game. Even if no one is going to see my report, but I will frankly recommend not to play a game with him. I also met [Shuangshuang](http://www.shuangshuang.li/), but it seemed that I offended her with my words. Please forgive me as a young kid. She was also an interesting person with brilliant skills in design. [Xianheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xianheng_Guan) applied for a PhD and continued his academic life on Mechanical Engineering at University of Pittsburgh. I missed him since we used to go out for I Tea Cafe a lot. Hope he is doing well. I met [Nannan](https://www.oldcs.pitt.edu/people/view/naw66) while living in Squrriel Hill. I am looking back to go to Pittsburgh once again. Adam is a strong developer with creative ideas. I would say it is enough for a start up company with three developers like Adam. I missed them all. //Added on 18/Nov/2018

## Drunkwalk
For the summer, I went to Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) to work on a project with UAV swarms. 

## PoseSimulator
I joined the research group in Purdue, under the supervision of Professor He Wang.
