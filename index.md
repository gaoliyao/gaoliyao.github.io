I am a student at Purdue Univesity in Mathematics. I am doing research in deep learning under supervision of Professor [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/). I used to work as a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in learning theory, non-convex optimization, and neural network ensembles.

## Ongoing projects:

2019 - now Research Assistant at Purdue University, instructed by Professor Guang Lin and Dr. Wei Deng.
- Non-convex optimization via SG-MCMC in deep learning. 
- Group-Equivariance Convolutional Neural Networks. 
- Machine learning under rotation invariant condition for high order tensors.

Note: these two works are related to brain dynamics in some sense. I am still trying to make better connection between these two concepts (of Cortex and Ensembles).
