## Current: 
I am a student at Purdue Univesity in Mathematics. I am doing research in deep learning, instructed by Professor [He Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hw/) and Professor [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/). I used to work as a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are on Learning Theory and Neural Network Ensembles.
