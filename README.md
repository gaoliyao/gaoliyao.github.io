## Current: 
I am an undergraduate student at Purdue Univesity. I am also doing research on deep learning at Purdue University, instructed by Professor [He Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hw/) in SIMBA Lab. I used to work as a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are on Learning Theory and Mobile System.
