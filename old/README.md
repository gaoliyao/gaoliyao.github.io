I am a student at Purdue Univesity in Mathematics. I am doing research in deep learning, Professor [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/). I used to work as a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are on Learning Theory and Neural Network Ensembles. I am really interested in Non-convex optimization problems (or MINLP), especially in the context of machine learning.
